## Uninstallable apps

Some bloatware cannot be removed at all:

## Roaming

Little staircase symbol with an R on top: means that you are using paid data: <http://www.galaxys5manual.com/android-icons-meaning/>

The staircase icon shows the strength of the wide LAN.

Turn off: <http://www.gadgetdaily.xyz/quick-tip-how-to-turn-off-data-roaming-on-android/>

On 5.1, the "Mobile data" is also present on the default settings bar. It clearly explains that internet connection is gone unless you have Wifi.

## GPS

## Location

Most android smartphones have a GPS receiver. This is for examples why Google Maps can work even without WIFI.

GPS is not the only way to find your location: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/15009/how-does-google-maps-estimate-my-location-without-gps#>

Google has a private database of WIFI IDs, which it correlates to location by crowd-sourcing.

Turn off: Settings > Location. Does not seem possible to turn off just the GPS: Wifi tracking must be turned off as well. But it shows energy usage per app (power hog?), to it's fine.

## UI

### Status bar

### Google search bar does not fit anymore on the top of the home screen

### Ringtone

Remove gap: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/24466/how-do-i-remove-delay-between-ringtones>

Psychoacoustics: best type:

- <http://www.everydaylistening.com/articles/2011/5/29/the-definition-of-a-good-ringtone.html>
- <http://gizmodo.com/5983194/whats-the-best-ringtone-youve-ever-heard>

My take:

- high pitch is more audible
- more continuous sound is better
- not longer than 4 seconds so you know it is a ringtone, how many times it sounded, and not regular music
- does not start too abruptly so as to not jump scare you

Good song starts:

- qu yuan lisao
- return to forever medieval ouverture

#### Ringtone location

- http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/56905/where-is-the-default-ringtone-stored
- http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/123802/location-for-custom-ringtones-alarms-notifications-that-hides-them-from-play-mus
- http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/28300/how-to-manually-upload-ringtones-and-notifications-to-droidx

Best place seems:

    /system/media/audio/ringtones

`ogg` and `mp3` both worked fine.

#### Media scan

Songs don't show by default after you copy them manually there: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/56905/where-is-the-default-ringtone-stored/56908?noredirect=1#comment162980_56908>

You need to trigger the media scan.

One way to do that is to reboot.

From the CLI without rebooting: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/51784/can-i-trigger-a-media-scan-via-the-the-command-line>

There's an app for that: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.addz.mediascanner>

## Bloatware

Shitty software pre-installed by OEMs or carriers to get money from your personal information.

E.g., my Vivo (Brazilian carrier) + Sony Xperia Z3 has bloatware from both Vivo and Sony.

Apple forbids carriers from doing it it seems.

<http://www.greenbot.com/article/2920125/dear-carriers-please-stop-putting-bloatware-on-my-android-phone.html>

And on top of that, most bloatware cannot be uninstalled without rooting!!

### Skins

GUI changes made by OEMs or carriers to steal your data.

- Samsung: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TouchWiz>
- LG G UI
- HTC Sense UI
- Sony Xperia UI

### Stock device

No bloatware.

Near stock devices: <http://www.phonearena.com/news/Best-2015-smartphones-that-run-stock-or-near-stock-Android_id75780>

## App isolation

from a terminal emulator app.

### Root

### sudo

TODO what does it do exactly?

- <http://gizmodo.com/5982287/reasons-to-root-your-android-device>
- <http://www.androidcentral.com/root>
- <http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-root-android/>

Many rooted apps are available on the Play store itself. Google is much less restrictive than Apple is about jailbreaking.

You need to backup your ROM and replace it with a new one.

Kingo Root method: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWNykj-lb-I>

Once you have it, just type `su` on the SSH session or terminal emulator and go.

### ROM

Read only memory.

Stores the OS.

Mounted under `/system`

If you root the device, you can change it, and make a custom Android however you like.

#### Internal storage

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25361238/difference-between-internal-sd-card-and-internal-storage>

The internal SD card is partitioned and mounted as follows:

- `/system` is mounted readonly and is the ROM
- `/sdcard` internal SD card
    - `/sdcard/Music` main music location. Apps will look there by default, but on other places as well. TODO API enforced, or just convention?
    - `/sdcard/Pictures` stock pictures
    - `/sdcard/Pictures/Screenshots`
    - `/sdcard/Ringtones`
    - Play Music location: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/16220/where-does-google-music-store-offline-songs>
- `/data` is called "Internal storage", and contains apps and their data
- `/storage`

### USB debugging mode

TODO? What is that?

Enabled from Developer options

Disable the eternal notification: <http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/5075/how-do-i-disable-the-usb-connected-notification>

### Tether

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering>

Requires root, but available on Google Store.

Carriers may require you to pay for that if you tether from their network instead of LAN, which is why Android disables it by default.

Root allows you to re-enable that.

## Google play

Software distribution.

There is manual guideline reviewing. No test apps accepted. No porn, violence, etc. Bullshit.

Content policy: <https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html>

### Distribute App without Google Play

- <http://developer.android.com/distribute/tools/open-distribution.html>
- <http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/90523/how-can-i-publish-an-android-game-without-google-play>

Don't forget to enable non-Google Play sources under:

    Sources > Security > Unknown sources

### Google store

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Store

Sells hardware.

### Publishing on Google Play

You have to pay a `25$` signup fee!

<https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-publish-an-Android-app-free-in-the-Google-Play-store>

You need an alternative Android market. Huge list: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6939652/where-can-i-upload-my-android-apps-for-free>
